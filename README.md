Big thanks to ian0036 for his work in creating a CloudFormatioon Transform for Amazon Connect!!

His repository can be found here: https://github.com/iann0036/amazon-connect-cfn

This is required to be able to deploy the stack with Amazon Connect. It was a little bit outdated, so I forked it and reimplemented the Lambda function to make use of the AWS SDK helper functions for Amazon Connect. That can be found here: https://github.com/Caoimhin89/amazon-connect-cfn.git
