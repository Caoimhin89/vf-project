*Big thanks* to @ian0036 for his work in creating a CloudFormation Transform for Amazon Connect!!

His repository can be found here: [Link to Repo](https://github.com/iann0036/amazon-connect-cfn)

This is a required element to be able to deploy the stack with Amazon Connect. It was a little bit outdated, so I forked it and reimplemented the Lambda function to make use of the AWS SDK helper functions for Amazon Connect and updated the puppeteer code where necessary to account for changes Amazon made in the Connect UI since the time the repository was first created. I also moved out some dependencies into a separate Lambda Layer, since the build came to be just over 50MB. 

That can be found here: [my fork'd version](https://github.com/Caoimhin89/amazon-connect-cfn.git)


# VoiceFoundry Assignment

## Objective
To make this more fun, I decided to add a requirement to the project. I'm keeping all the original requirements, but instead of just uploading a nondescript file to S3 and transferring its data to a DynamoDB table, I plan to upload an agent directory CSV to S3 and use that to update an Amazon Connect instance, which I plan to also create in this project.

### Day 1
* Created an S3 Bucket & boilerplate for Lambda function
* Created a DynamoDB Table
* Added a plugin to support object uploads to S3 on deployment
* Added Amazon Connect
    * Things started to get tricky here. I found the above-mentioned CloudFormation Transform for Amazon Connect support, but noticed the CloudFormation Stack was failing. I discovered the the reference to the AWS managed policy, AmazonConnectFullAccess, was incorrect (it was probably correct at one time, but AWS updated the name), so I fixed the reference and the stack succeeded. I then returned to my serverless project and ran `sls deploy`. 
    
    * However, the CreateContactFlow step failed.
    I looked at the source-code and found that the Transform that gave CloudFormation its Amazon Connect support was utilizing a Lambda running headless-chrome via aws-lambda-chrome and puppeteer to actually log into the console and create the Amazon Connect instance. I returned to the repository named above and found that this was already a reported bug. 
    
    * So, I forked the repository and updated the Lambda's code to use the aws-sdk to create the Connect instance and the ContactFlow. I also moved out the aws-lambda-chrome and puppeteer dependencies to an independent Lambda Layer, as when I ran npm install and zipped up the deployment package, the size exceeded the 50MB limit for Lambda. However, I soon encountered another obstacle.
    * I found a strange bug, which I detailed here (along with what I did to try to resolve the problem): 
        * [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65057634/amazon-connect-in-creation-failed-status-after-successful-call-to-createinsta)
    * and also reported here:
        * [GitHub Issue Report](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/3557)
    
    * In short, when I called createInstance() via the aws-sdk for nodeJS from the Lambda function, it returned a successful response, but actually failed to create the instance. So this turned out to be the first serious obstacle it will be necessary to overcome in order to achieve the objective.

### Day 2
* Added JestJS for unit tests
* Added Lambda function to handle CreateObject events on S3 and save to DynamoDB
* Added some unit tests
* I put the Amazon Connect issue on hold to focus on completing the core challenge
* Added IAM role to Lambda function with the necessary policies to enable it to perform its function
* Updated the DynamoDB keys to use the key of the S3 upload object as HashKey and the sequencer attribute as RangeKey.

### Day 3
Back to trying to get the Connect Instance set-up through CloudFormation. The createInstance operation in the aws-sdk seems not to work, so I went back to using puppeteer for the creation of the instance, while relying on the SDK for deletion. Mostly a lot of back and forth occurred here, making changes to the code, deploying, reviewing logs and debug screenshots, and adjusting the code accordingly until it worked.

### Day 4
I finally got the Amazon Connect CloudFormation Transform working. I commited my changes to the forked repo for the Transform and created a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/iann0036/amazon-connect-cfn/pull/7) on the original repository. So, returning to the assignment, I've now gotten things to the point where upon deployment, the following takes place:

* DynamoDB Table is created
* S3 Bucket is created
* Lambda function deploys
* Files are uploaded to the S3 Bucket & the Lambda responds by saving the file data to the DynamoDB Table
* A Connect Instance is launched
* A Simple Disconnect ContactFlow is defined and associated with the Connect Instance
* A Phone Number is reserved and associated with the ContactFlow from the previous step

#### Now for the next step:

If a .csv file is uploaded to our Bucket, the Lambda handler responding the the CreateObject event should check to see
if the uploaded file contains agent data. If so, it should create an agent for each entry in the CSV and associate that agent with the Connect Instance. It's also probably better to keep our agent data separate from the other data we're storing in the DynamoDB table, so I'll create a separate Table just for agent data. It's also not really a great idea to store passwords in Dynamo, even if it's encrypted, so I'll store the agents' passwords in Secrets Manager, instead.

### Day 5
I updated the serverless.yml file to create the additional resources needed to meet the new requirements.
* DynamoDB Table to store Agent Data
* Lambda function to respond to events from the Stream associated with the new Table and create new Connect Users whenever a new Agent record is inserted into the Table.
* An IAM role with the appropriate policies to allow the Lambda to do its job
    
I also created a new suite of Jest unit tests to ensure the Lambda function code behaves as anticipated and then proceeded to build out the function logic until the tests passed.

--------
UPDATE: I just learned today that the reason the connect.createInstance() calls were not working was because this feature is currently in preview, but it works when using the latest version of the aws-sdk. So reimplementing that can be a TODO item for later.
--------

### Day 6
* Added additional inline policies to both Lambda functions in order to access SecretsManager & KMS
* Added SecretsManager API calls to create passwords for each agent, and also to retrieve them again
* Added additional Connect API calls to retrieve UserHierarchyStructure, SecurityProfiles, and RoutingProfiles

Success!! I was able to deploy the stack, which successfully created all the infrastructure, upload a .csv file containing agent data and have that data stored in a DynamoDB table (except for agent passwords, which are stored in SecretsManager), and then create a Connect user for each agent and associate each of them with the Connect Instance generated by the stack.
